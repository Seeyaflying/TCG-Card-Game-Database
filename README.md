Use this file to download all the cards in the mentioned type to a json for a database.

The Magic the Gathering one also downloads card images. This process will take a long time and will need to be ran two times for the whole collection.
Once the progress bar hits 100% you are good to go and move the pictures.


Notes:
I would love to add the Pokemon ones for pictures as well. 
Digimon one needs a full update.
